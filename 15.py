# Task:
# 15. find the length of a string without using built in function len() 

length = 'Yash'

for chars in length:
    for count in range(len(length)):# The range function will exlude the last character of string
        pass

print('The length of the string is ', count +1 )# why count + 1?because range function above will not count the last string
